# locallibrary

This is the tutorial I followed to create the local library site.

The main learning objectives were to create a application using node.js and to deploy it into production.

Challenges: Most of the challenges were learning the language to be used and how to find and fix some of the broken code.  I learned more from having mistakes that needed to be corrected than anything.

This project gave me a huge look into how a database connects to an app and how that communication is conducted back and forth.  I believe this will benefit me in the future by having a better grasp on the concepts of database ane website interactions.
